"description":"How much will it cost?
The update is free from Google and other manufacturers. If you are being asked to pay for an update it is likely to be a scam.
Will my apps work?
Android 12 has not changed the way the core operating system works, which means almost all apps should work fine straight out of the box if they have been updated in the last couple of years.",
